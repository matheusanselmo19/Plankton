#### The ability to perform displacements autonomously is crucial for mobile robots to be classified as autonomous. A simple task applied to the displacement issue is the application of the go-to-goal. This task is focused on deciding a pose, position and orientation, in the environment so that the autonomous system is able to move to it completely autonomously.

</br>

#### There are several ways to perform a go-to-goal task, to meet the desired actions, it is necessary that the vehicle's degrees of freedom be considered in the implementation, as well as the data pertinent to the location.

</br>

### Why the challenge?

</br>

#### The implementation and contextualization of a go-to-goal task are essential for a researcher and developer of autonomous systems because autonomous movement is one of the functionalities considered essential for many robots. 

</br>

### The Challenge

</br>

#### The underwater challenge will be fulfilled in the execution of the go-to-goal task. Vehicles must travel to a certain point in the environment. Upon reaching the specified point, the ROV with the camera will capture a photo of a sphere that will close to this point. After capturing the image, to complete the mission the vehicle will have to return to the starting position of the mission. To facilitate the execution of the challenge, it is recommended to build a [state machine](developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/State_machine) in C++ or Python.

#### The vehicle to be simulated will be the RexROV present in [repository](https://github.com/Liquid-ai/Plankton). The Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS2 Foxy version will are going to be used.

### First Things First. 

#### Considering that your machine is already configured to operate with ROS2 foxy version. Launch a terminal and create a directory for your workspace.

```
mkdir -p ~/<your_workspace_name>/src

cd ~/<your_workspace_name>/src

```

##### clone the following repository.

```
 git clone https://www.github.com/Liquid-ai/Plankton.git

```

#### Install the dependencies

```
cd ~/<your_workspace_name>

rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro foxy -y

```
#### In a new terminal, launch the environment in the gazebo.

```
source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh

ros2 launch uuv_gazebo_worlds ocean_waves.launch

```

#### To spawn the work vehicle, boot more from the terminals. In the first one

```
ros2 launch uuv_gazebo_worlds ocean_waves.launch
```
#### And in the second, to activate the speed controls

```
ros2 launch uuv_control_cascaded_pid joy_velocity.launch uuv_name:=rexrov model_name:=rexrov joy_id:=0

```

#### With the steps that were performed above it is now possible to start the challenge. Good job!
